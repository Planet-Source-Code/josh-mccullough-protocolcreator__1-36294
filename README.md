### Description

Creates a .REG file which, when ran, will allow your App to be spawned whenever "myApp://blahblahblah" is entered into a run dialog or web browser, etc... just like when you enter "http://blahblahblah" into the run dialog. A BAS module is included which makes it real easy to add this functionality to your app, just one line of code on your part. You can set a flag to allow only protocols that are not common, for example, entering 'http' with the flag set to false will throw an error, which can be caught and displayed in a message box or any other control. Give it a try and PLEASE vote for me if you find this code useful! Email me with questions and/or comments!
 
### More Info
 
You need to know how to call a function, thats all!
